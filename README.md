# The-Simon-Game-The-Complete-2024-Web-Development-Bootcamp

This repository contains the JavaScript (jQuery) code for a Simon Game project. The HTML and CSS files were pre-made, and my contribution focuses on implementing the game logic and interactions using JavaScript. The game was created as part of Dr. Angela Yu's The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy.
